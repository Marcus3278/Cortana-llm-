**Status**: Core application complete with enhanced user experience. Weather, web search, and all services integrated. LLM client enhanced with personality and better offline responses. Ready for Ollama installation to enable full AI capabilities.

## üìã Manual Ollama Installation Required

To complete the AI integration:

1. **Download Ollama**: Visit https://ollama.ai/download/windows
2. **Install**: Run the installer as Administrator
3. **Start Service**: Open terminal and run `ollama serve`
4. **Pull Model**: In another terminal, run `ollama pull llama2:7b-chat`
5. **Test**: Launch the Cortana LLM app with `npm start`

The application works fully in offline mode with comprehensive fallback responses, but Ollama enables advanced AI conversations and context awareness.
